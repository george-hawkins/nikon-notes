The original SVG is `turntable-plate-280mm.svg`.

The laser ready versions are:

* `turntable-plate-280mm-laser.plain.svg`
* `turntable-plate-280mm-laser.pdf`

I found that some services didn't correctly handle SVG but would handle the corresponding PDF.

`turntable-plate-280mm-laser-path.plain.svg` is for use with the Python length calculator logic needed for Lasergist (see [`ring-light`](../../ring-light)).

Assembly

This page documents the assembly of the turntable in photos.

Legs
----

Note that I later switched to using one leg as shown and another with a 5-hole bar and a single foot in the middle - in order to avoid issues with wobbling.

Pulleys and belt
----------------

I put down two layers of paper below the small pulley so I could push it down onto the bolts below when screwing it down and then rip the paper out afterwards and still have some clearance between the pulley and the bolts.

Improvement
-----------

I later replaced one of the legs with a 5-hole beam with a single foot to reduce the kind of wobble that often occurs when you have four legs (like a table where one leg needs to be propped up with beermats).

![one-foot](build/8-one-foot.jpg)

I used a 10mm bolt for the foot - a 12mm one would have been better but I didn't have one.

Scrapes
-------

I suspect the pieces are held in bins before being packaged for delivery - they're not completely free of scrapes and blemishes:

The main file is `ring-leds-and-lenses.svg`.

This was then split into `leds.svg`, `lenses.svg` and `ring.svg` for making laser templates.

Then for each there's a `.plain.svg` and `.pdf` version - I found some services got the dimensions wrong for `.svg` but did better with `.pdf`.

I produced `leds-laser-181x181mm.plain.svg` because the original had a slightly larger border which pushed it over the 181x181mm size for Finnpappe into a much larger size (which wasn't much more expensive but might've impacted postage).

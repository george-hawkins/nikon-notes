3D scanning sprays
==================

This [page](https://artecgroup.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205338441-Scanning-sprays) from Arctec3D has a nice breakdown scanning sprays, i.e. sprays that cover an otherwise reflective or transparent surface, in a thin chalk-like layer to make them more amenable to 3D scanning. It also covers various cheaper alternatives that are specifically designed for 3D scanning. Erik Christensen's video (linked to below) also covers various options.

TLDR; $40 for a can of Aesub Blue doesn't sound excessive. Of the much cheaper alternatives, I'd first try dry shampoo spray or applying talc (as described in Erik's video). Chalk sprays sounds like an interesting option if you're not concerned about affecting the sprayed surface.

3D scanning spray, as shown in promotional videos, has the advantage of no cleaning and that you can apply stickers (as additional feature markers) to the surface after spraying. I doubt stickers would adhere well to dry shampoo or chalk spray but I don't know.

## 3D scanning sprays

There are sprays specifically for this purpose, the most commonly mentioned and easily available are from Aesub - they have four variants:

* Aesub Blue - vanishes within a few hours.
* Aesub Orange - vanishes within 24 hours.
* Aesub Green - vanishes within 6 hours.
* Aesub White - requires cleaning to remove.

Aesub Green has to be used with a spray gun, the others come in spray cans.

Aesub Blue seems the most common and costs around $40 per can while Aesub White is a lot cheaper at around $18 (but requires cleaning).

There are a few other brands of sprays specifically for this purpose, e.g. Helling, but I didn't find them easily available online.

People seem to have had success with various cheaper alternative not specifically designed for 3D scanning.

Note that there's no guaratee that these products won't affect your object, e.g. one of the comments on Erik's video (see below) mentions that some chalk sprays can cause plastic parts to become faded - but I find it hard to believe that e.g. dry shampoo, body powder or talc should be particularly problematic.

## Chalk sprays

There are lots of chalk sprays (for use drawing out markings for children's games etc.). Whether they're all equally easy to remove, I don't know.

Watch out though - there are normal paints with a _chalk finish_, this isn't what you want if you want to be able to easily clean off the surface afterwards.

In German these are called Kreidespray or Sprühkreide.

These are typically very cheap, e.g. Maston [white chalk spray](https://www.maston.fi/en/front-page/product-information/spray-paints/chalk-paint/2500101/spray-chalk-white-150ml) is available in Switzerland from about Fr. 7.

Chalk spray is easily available from general stores (like Galaxus or Hornback in Switzerland) or arts and crafts stores.

## Developer and leak detector sprays

This is a rather more industrial product - when detecting flaws in welding work or leaks in piping a combination of three sprays are used:

* First you clean the surface with a cleaner spray.
* Then you cover it with a penetrant spray that gets into any cracks or flaws.
* Then you clean the surface again to remove the penetrant that hasn't worked its way into anything.
* Then you spray the surface with developer spray, this causes the penetrant spray in the cracks and flaws to become very visible, e.g. develop into a red color.

See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pixPTkAwgX0) to see exactly this sequence.

Some developer sprays, i.e. the third of these three sprays, seem to be suitable for covering objects in an easily removable matt surface.

However, I haven't found any of the brands, mentioned on 3D scanning site, particularly easy to source online. Magnaflux SKD-S2 comes up repeatedly but I couldn't find it available anywhere. Other mentioned brands such as Rocol Leak Detector spray and Crick 130 are available for around $15 to $20.

Note: Magnaflux do seem to have distributors everywhere in the world (including two in Switzerland), so it may simply be that SKD-S2 hard to find online (for some reason) but is available in physical stores.

In German, these sprays are called Lecksuchspray or Rissprüfmittel but I've no idea if such sprays are in general useful for 3D scanning or just particular brands.

# Dry shampoo, body/foot powder and talc

Also mentioned in the Arctec3D page and in Erik Christensen's [Scanning Featureless Objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krm9vDlTaxU) YouTube video are:

* Water soluable face paint.
* Dry shampoos.
* Body/foot powder.
* Talc

Batiste dry shampoo is mentioned and seems to be available everywhere (in New Zealand where Erik Christensen is, in the US where it's the number one dry shampoo on Amazon and here in Switzerland where it's available in Coop etc.) and is extremely cheap - around $5 for a can.

Gold Bond No Mess Body Powder is mentioned in the video (and comes up in various other places) - it's easily available in the US but less so in Switzerland.

You generally want the original or classic version of these products. Erik says you actually want to go for the cheaper dry shampoo and body powder products as the more expensive ones tend to be transparent.

In the end he uses talc/baby powder and just applies it manually with brushes - jump to the 6m 32s mark to see how he does this.

Some people mention using a mix of talc and isopropyl, Erik mentions this in a comment on his video:

> I didn't cover it in this video, but the spray bottle + 100% isopropyl and talc combo works very well, Leaves a awseome coating behind.
> The annoying part is that the isopropyl dissolved the plastic O rings inside all of my spray bottles and I only just found out before shooting this video....
> You need to be very careful though as the isopropyl can damage the surface you are coating, so test before application

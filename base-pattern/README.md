Patterns for placing under subject
==================================

The following are patterns that I created with the hope that they _might_ help Meshroom determine pose and orientation.

The first uses AruCo fiducial markers, that I was already familiar with. I just took a set of existing markers (from [here](https://mecaruco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks_rst/aruco_basics.html)) and added "rays" to help me place my camera at 15&deg; intervals, creating an SVG (in Inkscape). I then created an A3 PDF and finally split this onto two A4 pages in a final PDF.

* [`aruco-base.svg`](aruco-base.svg)
* [`aruco-base.pdf`](aruco-base.pdf)
* [`aruco-base-a4.pdf`](aruco-base-a4.pdf)

The second uses a cow pattern, rings and letters in a fashion similar to the pattern that Viz Guru describes in the [first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=010lAKpr7JE&) in his photogrammetry series (jump to the 19m 36s mark).

I constructed this with a CC BY tileable cow pattern that I found [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/anniekate/644895289), created by Annie Kate. I converted the original Jpeg to a vector graphic and added the rings etc. in Inkscape:

* [`cow-tile.svg`](cow-tile.svg)
* [`cow-tile.pdf`](cow-tile.pdf)
* [`cow-tile-a4.pdf`](cow-tile-a4.pdf)

In retrospect, a tileable pattern probably isn't the best idea - ideally, you'd like all features to be unique but I doubt this is a significant issue.

The main `README` also has a section covering the scale created by Samantha Thi Porter who has invested rather more time into all this than I have.

1 order arrived 3 Aug, 2021:

* cwrapping Official Store - very well packed, came in roll - [order details](https://trade.aliexpress.com/order_detail.htm?orderId=3012184323690496).

The material from Findohope is much more velvet-like than the cwrapping material which is much more flat matt, i.e. the Findohope material looks like what you'd use to line a jewelry box while the cwrapping material looks like the matt finish seen on cars.

Most things came wrapped in one or two layers of bubble wrap - for many things this is adequate - however, for something like the turntable it's not really enough.

25m is way more tape than you're ever likely to use - you can buy more reasonable 5m quantities from [nicelux](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32812832395.html).

Another manufacturer of LED drivers is [Lcfocus](https://lcfocus.aliexpress.com/store/group/LED-Driver/2335145_510573665.html) (their maximum voltage 600mA driver is [96V](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32913618520.html) and looks almost identical to QingYing models).

Photogrammetry
==============

Textured PiFuHD model of me - <https://skfb.ly/o6RyT> - created using the YouTube tutorial linked to below. Note the tutorial suggests using _Smart UV Project_ unwrapping which results in overlapping faces (which may be fine for background characters but caused big issues for me). By trial and error, I chose _Lightmap Pack_ instead which doesn't result in overlapping but has its own issues (you can see the unusual "noise" on the texture as bits of the texture break through from other areas of the model). Ideally, I guess one would manually add seams and unwrap as in the human unwrapping tutorial linked to below.

Glasses
-------

Any model of me would also need glasses, some examples I found on Sketchfab include:

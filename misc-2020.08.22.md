There appear to be no dimmable 700mA LED drivers with large sales numbers on AliExpress.

There are almost no PWM dimmable drivers, the only ones I could find were:

* https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32965649626.html
* https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32804510372.html

Oddly, these are more expensive and less powerful than equivalent products from MeanWell via Digikey, Mouser etc.

There are far more of the classic analog dimmable drivers such as this one:

* https://www.aliexpress.com/item/541026399.html

But again the prices aren't particularly good and none have high sales numbers.

Adafruit Bedazzler: <https://learn.adafruit.com/bedazzler?view=all>

Note: they use 18AWG wire for their setup with 1W LEDs.

Sparkfun have cool white 3W LEDs that have an actual datasheet:

* <https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13105>

And have their PicoBuck hookup guide that shows strings of LEDs in series being connected in parallel:

Note: the New Star River 60W 600mA LED driver states is draws a maximum of 0.8A AC.

Sparkfun relays:

* I2C - Max 5.5A @ 240VAC - <https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15093>
* Solid-state relay - 40A - <https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13015>

The solid-state relay has a Fotek branded datasheet. You can buy a much wider range of Fotek relays on AliExpress:

* <https://www.aliexpress.com/store/group/Solid-State-Relay/3108014_511957402.html>
* <https://www.aliexpress.com/store/group/Solid-State-Relay/108414_510827508.html>

Note: the second store, while having lower sales has a wider range and for the safety conscious has the plastic cover that's included with Sparkfun's version:

* <https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32861983155.html>

You can get 10A versions for AC (if powering directly from the wall) or for DC (if powering e.g. via a 12V or 24V supply):

* DC - <https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32860686417.html>
* AC - <https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32864710065.html>

You can also get heat sinks for this style of relays but these are only really necessary if drawing 40A or more:

* <https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000465891094.html>

You can get apparently identical products with Jotta branding here:

* <https://jotta.aliexpress.com/store/group/Single-Phase-Solid-State-Relay/1501753_518666897.html>

As some of their photos include Fotek branding and as Sparkfun uses Fotek branded relays, I'm inclined to favor Fotek.

You cheaper non-solid-state relays, e.g. here:

* <https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001714620325.html>

Adafruit have latching-relays, this means they only consume power when switching on or off (with non-latching, you need a small but continuous current to keep them on with solid-state ones needing a far lower continuous current than the older style):

Color checker cards
-------------------

X-Rite seems to the leader in providing these kinds of cards. They were recently acquired by Calibrite and there are now near identical products with Calibrite and X-Rite branding - the plan though seems to be to transition to all Calibrite branding.

E.g. you can buy the X-Rite ColorChecker Classic now:

* <https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/465286-REG/X_Rite_MSCCC_Original_ColorChecker_Card.html>

But it's due to be replaced with the Calibrite ColorChecker Classic:

* <https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1649331-REG/calibrite_ccc_colorchecker_classic.html>

The X-Rite/Calibrite cards are pretty pricey though. The cheapest credible alternative seems to be Datacolor with e.g.:

Guide to glues that are suitable for electronics (and warnings as to what is corrosive):

* <https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/32812/27099>

Unfortunately, pure alkoxy glues are not available in hobbyist quantities even from Western suppliers, all reasonably priced products involve oxime.

**Important:** so make sure to use rubber gloves when working with these glues and use in a well aired setup.

Note: counterintuitively, these products will not dry if the air is completely dry.

Soldering pads with large ground plains and similar heat-drawing issues: the consensus seems to be don't jack up the temperature, it's tip size and wattage that matter, and applying flux to help solder flow onto the pad (rather than ball up). E.g. see this thread:

* <https://forum.arduino.cc/t/thermal-pads-to-gnd-plane-problems-soldering-any-tips/96615/3>

Note: the datasheet for the Sparkfun 3W LEDs says not to use more than 260C and for not longer than 5 seconds when soldering with lead-based solder.

Similarly, the datasheet for the Lumex 700mA gull-wing part says not to exceed 255C and not to bake for more than 60 seconds above 220C.
